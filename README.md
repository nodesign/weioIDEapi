# WeIO IDE API Documentation
The WeIO IDE API allows developers to connect their platform to WeIO IDE Frontend editor. It uses JSON-RPC to communicate between server (pc or some specific electronics like rPI, WeIO, Micropython,...) and WeIO Frontend code editor. In that way editing and running files in network becomes semsless.
